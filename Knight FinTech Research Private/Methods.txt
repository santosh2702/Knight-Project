Model: Deep Learning

Here i am using Deep Learning Model for the prediction of the wine variety using words in description/review.
Model won't be able to taste wine, but it could possibly identify the wine based on it's description.

Feature extraction:applied imputations on the data like Null data is being engineered.

Model accuracy: 0.69
i.e. 69%

Actionable insights on data:
1.Dealing with Null values.
2.Description of the wine is preferred.
3.Ignoring attributes like (user_name, review_title, country)
